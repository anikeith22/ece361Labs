We have implemented two additional features in our text conferencing app 

1. We have a register command from the client side that will register an user that will be added to the users database, 
it will check if that user is already in the database or not, if it is then registeration fails but if that user is not registered
then the server will register that user and also log them in at the same time, logging in with the unregistered user 
will not be allowed. 

2. We have a timer feature which will kick off an user from the text conferencing app if this user does not make any messages (for 20 seconds)
once logged in a session.
